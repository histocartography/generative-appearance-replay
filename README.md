# Generative Appearance Replay

Generative Appearance Replay is a novel segmentation method for strictly continual domain adaptation wherein no access to the source domain or other previously seen domains is required.
The PyTorch code to reproduce the results of our corresponding paper [Generative appearance replay for continual unsupervised domain adaptation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841523001846) will be added here soon.
